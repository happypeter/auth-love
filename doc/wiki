# media host

follow RC, i use media.happypeter.org to share my videos, have this for lover:httpd.conf, 
BE sure to put media.happypeter.org below auth-love, other wise www.happypeter,org will be redirected to media.

#NOTE:

if python-pygments is not installed, your code block will be lost
so a little annoying to have a python app in rails

BUG mac pygment:

Now on mac, I 

    sudo easy_install pygment

and then

    cd auth-love
    r s

now if I view the site at 127.0.0.1:3000, every thing works all right, but if I view it with Passenger
the error when I try to use `markdown()`:

    No such file or directory - posix_spawnp

the same error shows up if I use `r s` to view the site, but `rm pygment`
Why?

## git-backed wiki

Gollum is a simple wiki system built on top of Git that powers GitHub Wikis.

I want this, it could be especaillly useful when you want the audience change your book.
having this, they no longer need to clone your repo first

## mysql 

rails new happywords -d mysql
>drop database ddd_test;

Q: About the mysql-adapter issue, it was strange for me, why in railscasts
it is just "mysql" in it, while my authlove has to have "mysql <0.3" in Gemfile

A: I think when I check the Gemfile.lock,     

   mysql2 (0.2.6) 

was in railscats one, now I see its becasue railscasts was depolied long time ago, so mysql2 was installed as the lower version, and then was locked, so "bundle install" just instlled the old one.

ERROR: when rake db:create

    Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/tmp/mysql.sock 

The fix:

   change ../config/database.yml and have the socket location in /etc/mysql/my.cnf
### bundler

`bundle install` will simple install whatever in Gemfile.lock, then I will still have `will_paginate.3.0.pre2` installed, but if I run `bundle update`, the lock file will be changed, and now `will_paginate.3.0.0` will be used, that cause this error:

    undefined method `paginate' for #<Array:0x00000102688aa0>

since my current will_paginate works, so I do not want to do a update.

NOTE: need to restart apache to test things, when using "passenger + ENV= development".
### mysql commands

#### how to delete a db record and also decrements the id

    first dump the db into a sql file(better to use one line format)
    remove the record you hate
    decrement the id after AUTO_INCREAMENT=?
    restore the db


Delete a row(s) from a table.

    mysql> DELETE from [table name] where [field name] = 'whatever';
 
clear user's password_hash

   mysql> use authlove_development;
   mysql> update users set password_hash="" where id=1;
   # "" is NOT NULL, this is obvious when you check this with phpmyadmin
   # and thus the code 
   #
   #    user.password_hash.empty?
   #
   # is usable when set password_hash to ""
   #
   # but when I change password_hash to NULL with phpmyadmin, I have to change
   # the code into
   #
   #    user.password_hash == nil

how to dump a db:

    mysqldump -uroot authlove_development>authlove_development.sql

how to restore a db:

    mysql> create database authlove_development; # with rails, this is done by "rake db:create;rake db:migrate"
    Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

    peter@server-me:~/happynewsdb$ mysql -uroot authlove_development<authlove_development.sql 

that's all

for better git history, I think I need something to separete different records in to different lines.
    
    peter@lover$ cd local_clone/happynewsdb/
    mysqldump --extended-insert=FALSE --complete-insert=TRUE -uroot authlove_development >authlove_development.sql 

## don't use phpmyadmin to delete posts entry

because the comments belong to it won't be deleted, and thus a error when you try to list
user homepage, then a comment who's master post was delelted will produce a error.

## passenger

just follow the lead of 

    passenger-install-apache2-module 

NOTE: don't put "#" comment lines into httpd.conf, error on syntax

the two warnings does not hurt:

    root@server-me:/etc/apache2# apachectl -S
    apache2: Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using 127.0.1.1 for ServerName
    [Sat Jun 25 17:01:18 2011] [warn] NameVirtualHost *:80 has no VirtualHosts

finally have this in httpd.conf:


    LoadModule passenger_module /home/peter/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p180/gems/passenger-3.0.7/ext/apache2/mod_passenger.so
    PassengerRoot /home/peter/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p180/gems/passenger-3.0.7
    PassengerRuby /home/peter/.rvm/wrappers/ruby-1.9.2-p180/ruby

    NameVirtualHost *:80

    <VirtualHost *:80>
       ServerName www.yourhost.com
       DocumentRoot /home/peter/auth-love/public/ 
       RailsEnv development
       <Directory /home/peter/auth-love/public/>
          AllowOverride all             
          Options -MultiViews          
       </Directory>
    </VirtualHost>

things works, development db is in use now

    tail -f log/development.log 

to see the log file, learned form railscasts.com:122

## phpmyadmin

so I have to set another VirtualHost, and put it BEFORE "LoadModule passenger", now
have "phpad.com" in /etc/hosts on my real machine, so it works, when call the same ip 
with http://phpad.com/, refer to :http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/vhosts/name-based.html


this is my httpd.conf

    <VirtualHost *:80>
       ServerName phpad.com
       DocumentRoot /usr/share/phpmyadmin/ 
    </VirtualHost>
    LoadModule passenger_module /home/peter/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p180/gems/passenger-3.0.7/ext/apache2/mod_passenger.so
    PassengerRoot /home/peter/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p180/gems/passenger-3.0.7
    PassengerRuby /home/peter/.rvm/wrappers/ruby-1.9.2-p180/ruby

    NameVirtualHost *:80

    <VirtualHost *:80>
       ServerName sme.com
       DocumentRoot /home/peter/auth-love/public/ 
       RailsEnv development
       <Directory /home/peter/auth-love/public/>
          AllowOverride all             
          Options -MultiViews          
       </Directory>
    </VirtualHost>


## markdown
I don't know, so I checked the jekyll code and I know:

jekyll->markdown->maruku->syntax(not coderay)

## file upload

2.1 What are Sessions?

— HTTP is a stateless protocol. Sessions make it stateful.

Most applications need to keep track of certain state of a particular user. This could be the contents of a shopping basket or the user id of the currently logged in user. Without the idea of sessions, the user would have to identify, and probably authenticate, on every request. Rails will create a new session automatically if a new user accesses the application. It will load an existing session if the user has already used the application.

A session usually consists of a hash of values and a session id, usually a 32-character string, to identify the hash. Every cookie sent to the client’s browser includes the session id. And the other way round: the browser will send it to the server on every request from the client. In Rails you can save and retrieve values using the session method:
session[:user_id] = @current_user.id
User.find(session[:user_id])

## crul

    curl -i     http://192.168.1.103:3000/sessions

good way to test

## rails.vim

`gf` rocks

## migration

the rake db:migrate failed in the middle, because I have some syntax error in.

fix all the error then:

    rake db:migrate

not working, since some column has already been added 


try: 
rake db:migrate:down VERSION=20110910074643 

of no use, and It seems this only works on fully successful migration. 

so delete mysql colum manually:

    alter table comments drop ancestry 

fix the issue.
