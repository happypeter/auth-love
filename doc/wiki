## mysql 

Q: About the mysql-adapter issue, it was strange for me, why in railscasts
it is just "mysql" in it, while my authlove has to have "mysql <0.3" in Gemfile

A: I think when I check the Gemfile.lock,     

   mysql2 (0.2.6) 

was in railscats one, now I see its becasue railscasts was depolied long time ago, so mysql2 was installed as the lower version, and then was locked, so "bundle install" just instlled the old one.

ERROR: when rake db:createi

    Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/tmp/mysql.sock 

The fix:

   change ../config/database.yml and have the socket location in /etc/mysql/my.cnf

## markdown
I don't know, so I checked the jekyll code and I know:

jekyll->markdown->maruku->syntax(not coderay)

2.1 What are Sessions?

— HTTP is a stateless protocol. Sessions make it stateful.

Most applications need to keep track of certain state of a particular user. This could be the contents of a shopping basket or the user id of the currently logged in user. Without the idea of sessions, the user would have to identify, and probably authenticate, on every request. Rails will create a new session automatically if a new user accesses the application. It will load an existing session if the user has already used the application.

A session usually consists of a hash of values and a session id, usually a 32-character string, to identify the hash. Every cookie sent to the client’s browser includes the session id. And the other way round: the browser will send it to the server on every request from the client. In Rails you can save and retrieve values using the session method:
session[:user_id] = @current_user.id
User.find(session[:user_id])
