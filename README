# DESIGN

 - a ticket system like http://news.ycombinator.com/
 - authlove.com/yourname   shows all your own tickets and comments
 - inspired by railscasts:episodes#create, I want users and myself(mainly myself), to upload videos, audios, pics

    - railscasts have a note for each video, I can have this by having the ticket text(markdown-backed)
    - be it a audios or pics or anything, the ticket model won't get complex, all are of one type, "attachedfile"
      with name a location
    - then I get whatever I want: blog, forum, railscasts,... all as tickets, so I need a tagging system
    - and even some hard-coded nav pages if necessary, 
      say happycasts, by choosing only tickets with tag: video&&vim plug author=happypeter
    - now user and I are all equal, we are all people who can submit one thing: a ticket

 - echo ticket will be given a unique number, and let's see how
   big the number will grow, and the biggest number will show on top like railscasts.com
   rather then the Hacker News 1,2,3,4... style
 - it is not twitter, it is not HN, and I will still keep my blog, the system will start simply as 
   a newer ticket sits on top of the rest older ones, then what's on the tickets? Anything, be it a 
   question from my students on vim or git, be it any other topic

# Hacker News
 
 - you click on a users name, and then you get all his posts
 - then we you click on his posts, you can also see who replied him
 - so on and so forth, you get whatever you need, really neat
