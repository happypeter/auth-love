# DESIGN

 - a ticketing system like http://news.ycombinator.com/
 - authlove.com/yourname   shows all your own posts
 - echo ticket will be given a unique number, and let's see how
   big the number will grow, and the biggest number will show on top like railscasts.com
   rather then the Hacker News 1,2,3,4... style
 - when there are more than 100 tickets, maybe I will add search or tags to
   all the tickets to have people find stuff 
 - it is not twitter, it is not HN, and I will still keep my blog, the system will start simply as 
   a newer ticket sits on top of the rest older ones, then what's on the tickets? Anything, be it a 
   question from my students on vim or git, be it any other topic

# Hacker News
 
 - you click on a users name, and then you get all his posts
 - then we you click on his posts, you can also see who replied him
 - so on and so forth, you get whatever you need, really neat

# RELEASE NOTES
v0.3 release note:

 - /username gives a user homepage
 - /users  gives a user list ( maybe give a sorting by karma is a good idea?)
 - /nonexsitname gives a error msg and redirect to root_url
 - more HackerNews feathers and style
 - done with most what I want 
 - no obvious bug 

v0.2 release note:

 - comments put into concern
 - hide unauthorized action on view (edit, destroy...)

v0.1 release note:

 - user can login&logout
 - post only if you login
 - auth check for delete or edit but not show
 - the logic works, but the view is still very primitive
